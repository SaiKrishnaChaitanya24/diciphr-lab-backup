                <b>Postdoctoral Researcher in Neuroimaging at DiCIPHR Lab, Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania</b><br><br>
                The DiCIPHR (Diffusion & Connectomics in Precision Healthcare Research) Lab invites applications for postdoctoral positions.
                <a href="../index.html">DiCIPHR</a>, led by Dr. Ragini Verma, is dedicated to patient-oriented neuroimaging research, aiming to
                advance our understanding of the association of disease related structural and functional connectivity alterations in the brain,
                and symptoms. Such clinically focused investigations are rooted in advanced mathematical and computational tools for diffusion
                MRI analysis, as well as multiparametric connectomics. These tools encompass processing pipelines, automated quality control and
                multi-site harmonization and have enabled investigations in sex differences, brain development, autism, brain tumor, and traumatic
                brain injury. Investigation of these clinical questions have been further facilitated by network neuroscience research in communication
                schemes, network reorganization strategies, as well as pre-clinical mechanistic investigations.<br><br>
                <b>Position Overview:</b><br>
                The postdoctoral researcher will engage in cutting-edge research involving computational analysis of neuroimaging data. Projects will
                explore the integration of diffusion MRI (dMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate brain connectivity, network dynamics, and their
                implications for various neurological conditions. Potential projects include, but are not limited to, investigation of brain connectivity
                in traumatic brain injury, developmental disorders, and brain cancer. The projects span the development of harmonization methods, 
                deep-learning-based diagnostic and therapeutic tools, surgical planning aids, normative modeling for disease-specific anomaly detection and
                creating patient-specific imaging biomarkers. While the focus of the lab is neuroimaging, projects involve the integration of imaging with
                omics and clinical data. These are <b>on-site</b> positions, starting immediately. They are initially a one-year contract with the possibility of renewal based
                on mutual agreement, performance, and funding availability.<br><br>
